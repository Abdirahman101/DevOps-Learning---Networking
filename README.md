# üåê NGINX on AWS EC2 with Custom Domain (Route 53)

This project demonstrates how to deploy an NGINX web server on an Amazon EC2 instance and map it to a custom domain registered through AWS Route 53.

## ‚úÖ Project Goals

- Purchase a domain via Route 53
- Launch and configure an EC2 instance
- Install and run NGINX
- Set up DNS (A record) to route traffic to the instance
- Serve the default NGINX page at: `http://nginx.Abdirahmanlearning.com`
